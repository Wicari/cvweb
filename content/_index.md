## Welcome to our Gaming Community

We are a multi-verse gaming community. The core of the Cosmic Vomit has been involved together in gaming for over 15 years. We have played a multitude of games toget
her such as DAoC, Warhammer, Star Wars, and of course Warcraft to name a few. There pretty much isn't a MMORPG out there that we have not explored to some extent for
 a period of time. Some may come and go but we have a great community both in and out of gaming so welcome to the fun. Most of us are 30+ and some like Wicari are ap
proaching their geriatric years (laughs). We are fun loving pranksters that love to poke fun at each other and make fun of each other. We are not serious and yes we
have an 'adult' sense of humor so if you are joining you must be 18+. We like to succeed in games but at the same time try not to get overly serious or elitist about
 our gaming. Our main goal should always be to have fun in whatever we do.

Currently we are playing:  World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, Final Fantasy XIV, Valheim, Lost Ark
