## GENERAL CODE OF CONDUCT 
### SERVER AND IN GAMES


Be respectful of other Cosmic Vomit members, officers, their abilities, their contributions, and any extra duties they perform within a game to keep the guild running. We are here to have a good time with friends first and foremost.

No malicious hate speech, discrimination, harrassment of other players in discord or within a game will be tolerated.

You are part of a community. When playing various games we succeed as a group, not as individuals so  self-centered and self-absorbed attitudes are not helpful to have an inviting environment. If you feel someone is not 'pulling their weight' find ways to help them succeed instead of tearing them down for what they are not doing right.

Not everyone will agree with everyone else, conflicts will inevitably arise. As adults, members are expected to either try to resolve disagreements with other players civilly, privately, and independently. Failing that, try to work around it. Approach an Officer for assistance if you have exhausted all other options.

Constructive feedback and discussion on all aspects of how the guild is run, grouping and raiding within a game are always welcome through discord discussions or discussions outside of major guild events such as raiding. Complaints should not be made unless accompanied by an alternate solution.

Read Discord. Discord is the main way of communicating important Cosmic Vomit information. Most importantly, large group event strategies, raid strategies and guild announcements are made there. It is your responsibility to check Discord regularly and stay apprised of any important information on the game(s) we are playing.
