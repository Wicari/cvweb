## GENERAL RAIDING RULES

Every Raider is expected to do their best. We are not a hardcore guild, we love to have banter and fun while killing trash. But we do love to kill bosses and see pro
gression through raid tiers as well.

The Raid Leader is the boss. Please do not interrupt or over speak when they are giving instructions and follow the directions they provide. Disagreement discussions
 about strats can be done outside of raid times with the Raid Leader.

Sign Up and be punctual. Please use the raid bots in discord to sign up for each and every raid. Whenever possible please try to be online 10-15 minutes ahead to get
 to the raid entrance and be ready to zone in. This will help us decide if we are short on needed classes, get pugs and still start our raid on time.

Positive criticism is a good thing. Members should feel free to give advice and suggestions to other players to improve their play. Equally, Members should view any
positive criticism as an opportunity to improve.

Come Prepared. Watch videos posted on Discord, have plenty of flasks, oils, armor kits, sharpening stones, potions etc to make sure the raid is successful. Make sure your gear is fully repaired and fully gem'd and enchanted. Most gems and enchants can be found in the guild bank to use, if you do not see what you need ask an officer for help.

Monday and Friday are progression nights. This is where we work on content that is not on farm for us as a guild. This is for main characters only unless you are asked to bring an alt to fill a certain class shortage. If you want to bring your friends please make arrangements first with the Officers.

Progression nights have a recommended ilvl of (TBD). There may be some exceptions to this rule based on class need fills or the person is exceeding marks. Alt runs are open to anyone 70+, recommended they have ilvl of (TBD) gear but not a hard line.

To attend heroic raid night you must have cleared the current raid dungeon at least once on normal and understand the fights. If you are unsure of the fights we suggest pugging some normal runs to get the mechanics down of all bosses before you raid heroic with us.
