## Raid Loot

- If its your first raid with us you must ask to roll need on an item before doing so and get it approved. This just makes it fair to people who have been raiding with us longer for a specific item drop.

- For BOE Items - If you do not need it these will only be offered for main spec roll only to others. If no one rolls, congrats! You can do with it as you choose.

- If you win a BOE item you must equip it and be inspected to verify it was equipped.

- We want to make sure everyone that has an opportunity to get an upgrade can. Please roll on any items you need but also understand that if you have already won an item you may be passed over on your next win to give to someone that has not received a drop.
