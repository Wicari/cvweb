## Cosmic Vomit - Etrigg US ##

Regarding our WoW guild presence, we are currently playing alliance on the Etrigg-US server and are
progressing through Shadowlands content.  We are an older gaming crowd with ages ranging from 30+ to 50+.
While we have some younger than our median, we require you are 18+ to join. Our sense of humor can get twisted
and NSFW in nature. We are a bit of pranksters and love to poke fun at each other, if you get offended easily,
we are probably not the guild for you. When it comes to raiding, we like to succeed in progression but at the
same time try not to get overly serious or elitist about things.

We're not too casual but not the sweaty "More dots! Handle it!" types either.

## Recruitment

Current Progression: Starting Normal - ***Vault of the Incarnates***  
Raid Times:  
- Mon 8:00 PM EST - 10:30 PM EST
- Fri 8:00 PM EST - 11:00 PM EST (may go later)

We are currently looking to add more players in the following areas:

- Healing All classes but with a higher focus on Priest, Druid, Paladin.  
- DPS All classes.
